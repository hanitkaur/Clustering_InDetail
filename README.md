# Introduction

Clustering is a fundamental technique in machine learning and data analysis, and it's used to group similar data points together. This notebook explores various clustering algorithms and demonstrates their application on sample datasets. The goal is to help you understand the different types of clustering and how to use them effectively.

# Clustering Algorithms
This notebook covers several clustering algorithms, including:

## K-Means Clustering

Description: A centroid-based clustering algorithm that groups data into K clusters.

Usage: sklearn.cluster.KMeans

## DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)

Description: A density-based clustering algorithm that discovers clusters of varying shapes and identifies outliers.

Usage: sklearn.cluster.DBSCAN

## Hierarchical Clustering

Description: A hierarchical clustering method that builds a tree of clusters.

Usage: scipy.cluster.hierarchy

## Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)

Description: A probabilistic model that assumes data is generated from a mixture of Gaussian distributions.

Usage: sklearn.mixture.GaussianMixture

Each algorithm is explained in detail in the notebook.
